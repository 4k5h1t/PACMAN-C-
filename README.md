# PacMan: Chase on C++

<b>*PacMan: Chase*</b> is a game that was inspired by the retro arcade game **PAC-MAN** and draws many of the concepts and designs from the original.

But the premise of the game has a minor deviation from the original, it is focused primarily on chasing the ghost and trying to get the highest Score and not to finish the pellets before losing three lives like the original.

This was coded using Code:Blocks 17:12.

We use the WASD keys to move.
